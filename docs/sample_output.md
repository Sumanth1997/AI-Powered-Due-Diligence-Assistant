## 3. Due Diligence Report (Analyst Agent)

### Overall Assessment
Shopify presents a compelling growth story, but several claims require deeper scrutiny before investment consideration.

### Red Flags Identified

1. **Vague Metrics**
   - "200,000+" lacks precision
   - How is "active" defined?
   - What's the churn rate?

2. **Vanity Metrics**
   - GMV ≠ Revenue
   - High GMV with low take rates = inefficiency
   - No disclosure of actual revenue vs GMV

3. **Misleading Social Proof**
   - Celebrity merchant sales ≠ Shopify revenue
   - Name-dropping as marketing tactic
   - Unactionable data point

4. **Aggressive TAM**
   - $46B figure unsubstantiated
   - Core geography definition unclear
   - Competitive landscape not addressed

5. **Low Pricing Concerns**
   - $29/mo entry price raises profitability questions
   - Hidden fees not disclosed
   - Path to enterprise revenue unclear

### Key Questions for Founders

1. What is the exact active merchant count and how do you define "active"?
2. What is the customer acquisition cost (CAC) and lifetime value (LTV)?
3. Provide a detailed breakdown of revenue vs. GMV and take rates
4. Explain the methodology behind the $46B TAM estimate
5. What are the competitive moats against BigCommerce, WooCommerce?
6. Why is pricing so low compared to competitors?
7. What's the path to profitability given current expense ratios?

### Recommendation
**Proceed with Caution.** Require detailed financial documentation and independent verification of key metrics before advancing to term sheet discussions.
